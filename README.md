# Algorithms

Practice problems for a coding interview in Python.
---
Problems have been recently asked at the interviews in Google, Amazon, Uber, Facebook and Apple.

Naming convention of each problem tells you the difficulty level and the company where the problem was asked.

I will be dropping in 1 question everyday.

The detailed solution will be dropped in the next day. 

**HAPPY CODING!**
