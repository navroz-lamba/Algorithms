We can maintain a matrix cache where every entry [i][j] represents the minimum cost of painting house i the color j, as well as painting every house < i. We can calculate this by looking at the minimum cost of painting each house < i - 1, and painting house i - 1 any color except j, since that would break our constraint. We'll initialize the first row with zeroes to start. Then, we just have to look at the smallest value in the last row of our cache, since that represents the minimum cost of painting every house.\"\"\""
